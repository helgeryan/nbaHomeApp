# NBA Home App
Home for all things NBA, built in SwiftUI. Uses Alamofire for API calls using SportsRadar API endpoints on trial version.

This is an example app to show coding in SwiftUI in a fun way with NBA data from SportsRadar. Due to the app being on a trial service API calls are not made unless you toggle off the useMockData boolean inside of the class NBAService functions. Otherwise the app uses mock json data from the SportsRadar site to replicate the API calls.
